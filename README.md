<h5> Application that predicts the best teams week-wise to enter in the Fantasy Premier League. </h5>

-----------------------------------------
### Motivation, Challenge & Accomplishment

* **Motivation:** Building a real-world application to showcase my data analysis skills after completion of the Applied Data Science Specialization on Coursera. I have
been watching football since childhood and playing the Fantasy Premier League since 5 years. I thought of mixing my passions for data and football and improve my
standings in the Fantasy Premier League.

* **Challenge:** Analyzing and recognizing the appropriate features that can provide the best prediction with regards to the team, and deploying the application without
hassles.

* **Accomplishment:** The application has been deployed on Heroku and at the time of writing, the team entered in the Fantasy Premier League using the predicted teams
given by this application stands in the top 10 percentile.
